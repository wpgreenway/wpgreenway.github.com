# Will Greenway
### whois wpgreenway.com

I'm a software developer living in Franklin, TN with my wife and [two dogs](/assets/images/dogs.jpg). I love the Franklin/Nashville area and our developer community is full of great people and seems to be growing exponentially.

During the day I work with an awesome team developing web applications using a mix of Javascript (Backbone), Java (Spring MVC / Hibernate), and Oracle. At night I mostly hack around with Javascript / Coffeescript and Ruby / Rails.

I freely admit that 99% of the time I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing...but I love it.

You can find me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}) and [github](http://github.com/{{ site.github }}).
