I'm in the process of getting Jekyll set up the way I want and the new pages styled.

Big shoutout to both [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) for giving a good starting place for learning about Jekyll in general and to [@holman](http://twitter.com/holman) for open-sourcing his old template named [left](https://github.com/holman/left) that I'm using slightly modified until I have a chance to do a redesign.
